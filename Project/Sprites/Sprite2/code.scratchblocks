when green flag clicked
set [Sprite 2 only variable v] to [This should be in sprite 2]
say [Hello from sprite 2!]

when I receive [example message! v]
think [received example message!]

define run without screen refresh custom block #norefresh
repeat [10]
    say [this runs really fast!]
end

define not run without screen refresh custom block
repeat [10]
    say [this will pause for one frame after every iteration.]
end
